Instructions for building [Gnu Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed) as a native windows application

All patches under the same license as sources of [Gnu Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed): [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) or later

Author of the patches: Michael M. Builov (mbuilov@gmail.com)

## Fixed bugs:
- wrong directory of input file in in-place editing mode ('-i' switch) (sed: cannot rename ./sed8JEw8l: Improper link)
- sources were fixed for correct processing of text files with Windows line endings (if Sed is built under CYGWIN)
- fixed support of UTF-8 locale (e.g. "Russian_Russia.UTF-8", available starting with Windows 7)
- fixed interaction with standard Windows console in UTF-8 code page (set by chcp 65001)

## Added features:
- native Sed is capable for resolving wildcards in file arguments
- native Sed takes locale settings from environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG
- new switch '-C' or '--ignore-locale' - forces Sed to use the standard "C" locale; this switch is most usable in binary mode, to avoid possible interpretation of input data as multi-byte encoded strings (depending on the system locale)
- new switch '--locale' - to explicitly specify locale to use (and ignore environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG)

## Pre-built executables:
- [`sed-4.8-x64.exe`](/sed-4.8-x64.exe) - sed 4.8 built for windows7 x64 (sha1sum: 92ae48678f993e5391c41da7a1e7ae44ef9ce0a9)
- [`sed-4.8-x86.exe`](/sed-4.8-x86.exe) - sed 4.8 built for windows7 x86 (sha1sum: 47fd7cf06681fe68789ac3e45e6b8aa764200894)
- [`sed-4.8-xp.exe`](/sed-4.8-xp.exe)   - sed 4.8 built for windowsXP x86 (does not support .UTF-8 locale) (sha1sum: 29b452f63e846e247fbed9ba46757ee47ca1397f)
